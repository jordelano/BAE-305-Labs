# Summary
Learn to use electronic testing equipment that will be used for future labs. Equipment used includes Digital Multimeter (DMM), a Dedicated Capacitance Meter (DCM), an Oscilloscope (O-scope), a Function Generator (FG), and a Direct Current Power Suuply (DCPS); Measure and verify resistance of four resistors, capacitance of 4 capacitors, voltage output of DCPS, and function generator output, then compare results according to equipment used for measuring the outputs; The higher quality DMM (Fluke) was best for accurate measurements of the various circuit components in comparison to the generic DMM, but the Fluke was not as accurate or able to measure the small capacitance that the DCM could. Overall, the Fluke was most accurate when compared to the expected values or those shown on the output equipment.  

# Materials
Motors, 2 wheels, 2 line followers, top and bottom chassis, batteries, power supply stick, half bread board, TB6612 h-bridge, arduino

# Assembly Procedures
1. Collect 4 resistors and use color code to determine expected resistances and record those values - turn on Fluke DMM and generic DMM and set to measure Ohms (may need to adjust to kilo-Ohms or Mega-Ohms); 
2. Collect 4 capacitors and use code to determine expected capacitances and record those values - turn on Fluke DMM and DCM and set to measure Farads (may need to adjust to measure micro-Farads); 
3. Plug in DCPS, turn it on - set V1 and V2 output voltage to +1.5V, +7.0V, and +12.0V simultaneously as three separate trials, respectively - turn on Fluke DMM and set to measure voltage; 
4. Connect FG to proto board - set to produce 2kHz sine wave - adjust O-scope to show maximum amplitude - adjust O-scope so that the amplitude of the waves can be measured using methods outlined in Test Procedures


# Discussion
There were no intended alterations to the initial set up of the experiment that would impact the results. However, in future labs where resistance needs to be measured, the Fluke DMM will be used because it recorded values closest to the expected resistances. When capacitance needs to bee measured, the BK Precision 815 DCM will be used because it recorded values closest to the expected capacitances and within tolerance range. The Fluke DMM will be used to measure voltage from the DCPS because it gives a more precise reading than the scale shown on the DCPS meter. Finally, the Oscilloscope will be used to measure amplitude of sine waves because it is designed to do so and produces a voltage value more accurate than the DMM.
