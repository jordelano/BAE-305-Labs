# Summary
Learn to use electronic testing equipment that will be used for future labs. Equipment used includes Digital Multimeter (DMM), a Dedicated Capacitance Meter (DCM), an Oscilloscope (O-scope), a Function Generator (FG), and a Direct Current Power Suuply (DCPS); Measure and verify resistance of four resistors, capacitance of 4 capacitors, voltage output of DCPS, and function generator output, then compare results according to equipment used for measuring the outputs; The higher quality DMM (Fluke) was best for accurate measurements of the various circuit components in comparison to the generic DMM, but the Fluke was not as accurate or able to measure the small capacitance that the DCM could. Overall, the Fluke was most accurate when compared to the expected values or those shown on the output equipment.

# Assembly Procedures
1. Collect 4 resistors and use color code to determine expected resistances and record those values - turn on Fluke DMM and generic DMM and set to measure Ohms (may need to adjust to kilo-Ohms or Mega-Ohms) - measure actual resistance of resistors and record those values - compare to expected values as well as tolerance values - turn off equipment; 
2. Collect 4 capacitors and use code to determine expected capacitances and record those values - turn on Fluke DMM and DCM and set to measure Farads (may need to adjust to measure micro-Farads) - measure actual capacitance of capacitors and record those values - compare to expected values as well as tolerance values - turn off equipment; 
3. Plug in DCPS, turn it on - set V1 and V2 output voltage to +1.5V, +7.0V, and +12.0V simultaneously as three separate trials, respectively - turn on Fluke DMM and set to measure voltage - measure the actual voltage output of the DCPS and record those valuues - compare with DCPS expected values - turn off and unplug equipment; 
4. Connect FG to proto board - set to produce 2kHz sine wave - adjust O-scope to show maximum amplitude - adjust O-scope so that the amplitude of the waves can be measured using the following methods: 1) counting squares, 2) using moveable cursors, 3) using measurement features - finally, use the 4) generic DMM, & 5) Fluke DMM to measure the voltage output by the wires on the proto board - record each value - compare instrument measurements - turn off and unplug equipment

# Test Results
In conclusion, the equipment designated and designed to measure specific quanitities was more accurate and precise in reporting values of voltage, resistance, and capacitance. Something else to note is that the quality of the measurement equipment had an impact on the accuracy of the values produced when compared to the expected values of the given electrical circuit components. When equipment is cheaper, it may not be physically capable of measuring values without error.

# Discussion
There were no alterations to the initial set up of the experiment that would impact the results.
