# Summary
Learn to use electronic testing equipment that will be used for future labs. Equipment used includes Digital Multimeter (DMM), a Dedicated Capacitance Meter (DCM), an Oscilloscope (O-scope), a Function Generator (FG), and a Direct Current Power Suuply (DCPS); Measure and verify resistance of four resistors, capacitance of 4 capacitors, voltage output of DCPS, and function generator output, then compare results according to equipment used for measuring the outputs; The higher quality DMM (Fluke) was best for accurate measurements of the various circuit components in comparison to the generic DMM, but the Fluke was not as accurate or able to measure the small capacitance that the DCM could. Overall, the Fluke was most accurate when compared to the expected values or those shown on the output equipment.

# Assembly Procedures
1. Collect 4 resistors and use color code to determine expected resistances and record those values - turn on Fluke DMM and generic DMM and set to measure Ohms (may need to adjust to kilo-Ohms or Mega-Ohms); 
2. Collect 4 capacitors and use code to determine expected capacitances and record those values - turn on Fluke DMM and DCM and set to measure Farads (may need to adjust to measure micro-Farads); 
3. Plug in DCPS, turn it on - set V1 and V2 output voltage to +1.5V, +7.0V, and +12.0V simultaneously as three separate trials, respectively - turn on Fluke DMM and set to measure voltage; 
4. Connect FG to proto board - set to produce 2kHz sine wave - adjust O-scope to show maximum amplitude - adjust O-scope so that the amplitude of the waves can be measured using methods outlined in Test Procedures

# Test Procedures
1. Measure actual resistance of resistors with DMM probes and record those values - compare to expected values as well as tolerance values - turn off equipment;
2. Measure actual capacitance of capacitors with DMM probes and DCM probes and record those values - compare to expected values as well as tolerance values - turn off equipment;
3. Measure the actual voltage output of the DCPS with the DMM probes and record those valuues - compare with DCPS expected values - turn off and unplug equipment;
4. Measure the amplitude of the sine waves from peak to peak using the following methods: 1) counting squares, 2) using moveable cursors, and 3) using measurement features - finally, use the 4) generic DMM, & 5) Fluke DMM to measure the voltage output by the wires on the proto board - record each value - compare instrument measurements - turn off and unplug equipment

# Lab Questions Answered
1. The Fluke DMM measured values within the tolerance range of the expected resistor values, as did the generic DMM. The two DMM approximately agreed with each other.
2. The Fluke DMM and BK Precision 815 DCM approximately agreed with each other and with the expected value, but the Fluke was not able to measure the smallest capacitance, as its value for the .01μF capacitor was not within range. In this case, the DCM was used and agreed with the expected value of the capacitor. 								
3. The Fluke DMM and the DCPS approximately agree with each other. The DMM gives a more accurate and precise measurement because the DC Power Supply has a gage with wide increments on it, not allowing for many significant figures to be recorded.
4. The values measured using the O-scope do not agree with the values measured using the generic DMM or the Fluke DMM. The best method using the O-scope seemed to be using the moveable cursors or the measurement features. Counting the squares on the O-scope gave a very close approximation. The generic DMM did not come close to the correct output voltage of the sine waves, and while the Fluke DMM was within -1.1V of the actual output voltage, it was still not close enough to the actual amplitude voltage.

# Test Results
In conclusion, the equipment designated and designed to measure specific quanitities was more accurate and precise in reporting values of voltage, resistance, and capacitance. Something else to note is that the quality of the measurement equipment had an impact on the accuracy of the values produced when compared to the expected values of the given electrical circuit components. When equipment is cheaper, it may not be physically capable of measuring values without error.

# Discussion
There were no intended alterations to the initial set up of the experiment that would impact the results. However, in future labs where resistance needs to be measured, the Fluke DMM will be used because it recorded values closest to the expected resistances. When capacitance needs to bee measured, the BK Precision 815 DCM will be used because it recorded values closest to the expected capacitances and within tolerance range. The Fluke DMM will be used to measure voltage from the DCPS because it gives a more precise reading than the scale shown on the DCPS meter. Finally, the Oscilloscope will be used to measure amplitude of sine waves because it is designed to do so and produces a voltage value more accurate than the DMM.
